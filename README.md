# NOVUS
These are a small collection of tools that I've made for making my life easier when importing content to the source engine.

These tools were written hastily and poorly and were never intended for public release hence why they are released under the MIT license. 

# Usage

I would like it if you open a pull request with any changes that you have but you are not required to do so. It only makes the tool better for the people interested in using them.
